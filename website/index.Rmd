# About

This digital book written in **Markdown** for Reproducible Data Science (WILD6900). 
This book outlines elements of my PIPO project, which studies *pinus ponderosa* (Ponderosa pine, PIPO) regeneration
and plant community composition after reburns of high severity patches. Reburns, or fires that burn over an area
that has previously been burned, are not new in ponderosa forests. However, a shift toward reburns of high severity patches is new and is creating novel disturbance interactions on the landscape. My study investigates the impacts of reburns of high severity patches on ponderosa regeneration and plant community composition.

The content involves the creation of relational databases in SQL and data visualization with ggplot2 in R.
