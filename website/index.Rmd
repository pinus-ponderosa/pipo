# About

This digital book written in **Markdown** for Reproducible Data Science (WILD6900). 
This book outlines elements of my PIPO project, which studies *pinus ponderosa* (Ponderosa pine, PIPO) regeneration
and plant community composition after high severity reburn wildfires. The content involves the creation of relational
databases in SQL and data visualization with ggplot2 in R.
